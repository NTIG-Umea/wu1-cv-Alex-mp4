                <h4>Angel ―</h4> My siren daughter. Her control of technology has been a major piece to the puzzle. As such, I have promptly put her captive within the Hyperion database.
                <h4>Rhys Strongfork ―</h4> Current CEO of Atlas. I managed to bring this guy back on his feet after he became a Hyperion enemy in rough terms. We have to dismiss the whole part of me betraying him, that is not important, anyway.
                <h4>Timothy Lawrence ―</h4> One of my doppelgangers. 21-C, to be exact. He has been a loyal dog for as long as I remember. Not only that, he practically acts exactly like me. Sure, he is forced to do so but Timothy surely has a couple of positive things to say about me.
